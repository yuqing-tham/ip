Format:`help`

## Adding a Chore
Adds a Chore, which can be of 3 different types:
1. ToDo - represents a task that can be completed anytime.
2. Deadline - represents a task that must be completed before a specified deadline.
3. Event - represents a task that happens from a start date/time to an end date/time.

Format: 
1. `todo (chore description)`
2. `deadline (chore description) by (date and time in D MMM YYYY HHmm format)`
3. `event (chore description) from (date and time in D MMM YYYY HHmm format) to (date and time in D MMM YYYY HHmm format)`

Examples: 
1. `todo study for pl1101e test`
2. `deadline cs2103t ip work by 21 Feb 2025 2359`
3. `event cca meeting from 19 Feb 2025 2000 to 19 Feb 2025 2200`

Confirms the successful addition of the Chore by sending a confirmation message
and showing the current number of chores in the checklist. 

> Note that the end date and time for an event must not be earlier or equal to the start end date and time. 
> If entered incorrectly, Universe will prompt user to reenter the command.
